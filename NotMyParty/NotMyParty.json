  "Description": "Eliminate unwanted party finder entries. Type /nmp to bring up the config window and adjust to your liking. Open the context menu on a party finder listing to manually hide it/filter for it. Party finder needs to be refreshed for filtering changes to take effect. Note that this plugin can only filter one page at a time due to how party finder works, so you will still need to manually navigate through the pages if there are more than 50 in your current category/search conditions.",
