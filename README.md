# Installation Instructions
Use the `/xlplugins` command to open the Plugin Installer. Find the `Settings` button at the bottom to open Dalamud Settings. In the `Experimental` tab, scroll down to where it says `Custom Plugin Repositories`. Find the bottom-most text entry box and paste the following link into it
> https://raw.githubusercontent.com/doggjoe9/NotMyParty/master/NotMyParty/repo.json

A `+` symbol will appear on the right. Click that to add this repo to your repo list and then make sure the `Enabled` box is ticked. Click `Save and Close` at the bottom of the window, and the Plugin Installer will refresh. Once it is done, go to `All Plugins` -> `All` in the Plugin Installer. Search for `Not My Party` and click on it to get the `Install` button to appear. Once you have installed it, I recommend using the command `/nmp` to open the configuration menu.
